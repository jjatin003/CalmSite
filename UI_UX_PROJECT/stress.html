          <p class="text-light">Stress and anxiety are a normal part of life. Mindfulness training teaches you how to
            take a step back from both stress and anxiety, so youâ€™re better prepared to respond to stressful thoughts
            and situations.</p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Types of Stress </h2>
    <p>Acute stress: Acute stress is a very short-term type of stress that can either be positive or more distressing;
      this is the type of stress we most often encounter in day-to-day life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Chronic stress: Chronic stress is stress that seems never-ending and inescapable, like the stress of a bad
      marriage or an extremely taxing job; chronic stress can also stem from traumatic experiences and childhood trauma.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Episodic acute stress: Episodic acute stress is acute stress that seems to run rampant and be a way of life,
      creating a life of ongoing distress.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Eustress: Eustress is fun and exciting. It's known as a positive type of stress that can keep you energized. It's
      associated with surges of adrenaline, such as when you are skiing or racing to meet a deadline.</p>

    <h3 class="section-heading">Treatments for Stress</h3>
    <p>Stress is not a distinct medical diagnosis and there is no single, specific treatment for it. Treatment for
      stress focuses on changing the situation, developing stress coping skills, implementing relaxation techniques, and
      treating symptoms or conditions that may have been caused by chronic stress. Some interventions that may be
      helpful include therapy, medication, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).</p>
    <h4>Psychotherapy</h4>
    <p>Some forms of therapy that may be particularly helpful in addressing symptoms of stress including cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). CBT focuses on helping people identify and
      change negative thinking patterns, while MBSR utilizes meditation and mindfulness to help reduce stress levels.
    </p>
    <h5>Medication</h5>
    <p>Medication may sometimes be prescribed to address some specific symptoms that are related to stress. Such
      medications may include sleep aids, antacids, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety medications.</p>
